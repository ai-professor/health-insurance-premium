# Medical Insurance Premium

The goal of this project is to give people an estimate of how much they need based on
their individual health situation. After that, customers can work with any health
insurance carrier and its plans and perks while keeping the projected cost from our
study in mind. This can assist a person in concentrating on the health side of an
insurance policy rather han the ineffective part.

## Overview
This is a Health Insurance Web Application which predicts cost of insurance by getting user inputs.

## Motivation
The goal of this project is to give people an estimate of how much they need based on
their individual health situation. After that, customers can work with any health
insurance carrier and its plans and perks while keeping the projected cost from our
study in mind. This can assist a person in concentrating on the health side of an
insurance policy rather han the ineffective part.

```
- Activate the new Environment
```bash
  conda activate env_name
```

- Clone this Respository on Local Directory
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ai-professor/medical-insurance-premium.git
```

  
## Installation


- import required libraries on current directory
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
